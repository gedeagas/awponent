Most of React Native UI related components is scattered over the github, hackernews, FB groups, reddit. Here we try to create a portal for everyone to easily browse and experience the components. In the app we can search for a specific component or browse 
for the featured or new components. We can also like a component so that we can check it later on the favourite tab.
